# Operations

How the data is fetched, loaded and checked. Phase 1 runs by hand; the weekly update and publishing come later
(phase 2 onwards).

## Fetching

```bash
uv run landlords fetch                 # every source in config/sources.toml
uv run landlords fetch tsm             # one source
```

Each line of `config/sources.toml` names a page and how to find the file on it: a GOV.UK page and the attachment's
title, or another page and the link's address. A new year is a new line (a new `period`). Each run:

1. fetches each page once (GOV.UK pages through the Content API), one request at a time, a second apart;
2. downloads files whose address hasn't been fetched before (publishers put a changed file at a new address);
3. keeps each file as `data/raw/<source>/<sha256>.<ext>` with a note, and adds a line to that source's `index.jsonl`;
4. writes `data/staging/fetch-report.json`: new files, and sources that failed.

It exits 1 if a source fails: usually a page whose layout or file title has changed. Look at the page and update
`config/sources.toml`. Nothing already downloaded is touched.

## Loading

```bash
uv run landlords load                  # every source
uv run landlords load tsm grades       # some
```

Each loader reads the newest file for its source. It stops with "expected columns not found" or "sheet not found" if
the publisher has changed the file's layout: nothing is loaded from it until the loader is updated. The tables go to
`data/staging/`, never straight to the site.

## The register and names

```bash
uv run landlords register              # new landlords from the register; names publishers print beside a code
uv run landlords load ombudsman        # match the Ombudsman's names again
uv run landlords match                 # names still without a landlord -> data/staging/match-review.csv
```

Open `match-review.csv`, put `yes` in `accept` on the right candidate (and the alias `kind`: published, trading,
short, former, group, managing body or logo label), then:

```bash
uv run landlords match --accept data/staging/match-review.csv
uv run landlords load ombudsman
```

Display names, slugs, statuses and successors in `data_static/landlords.csv` are edited by hand and kept by
`landlords register`. When a landlord merges, set `status` to `merged`, with `successor_id` and `successor_date`, from
the regulator's own statement. Never change a slug that has been published; list published slugs in
`data_static/published_slugs.txt`.

## Checking

```bash
uv run landlords check
```

Every row matched to a landlord, the register sound, values in range, the publishers' totals reproduced
(`config/reconciliation.toml`), area codes known, homes by area against TSM populations, and a change report. It exits
1 if any check fails. The details are in `data/staging/check-report.json` and `change-report.json`.

When a new year is published, add its expected totals to `config/reconciliation.toml` from the publisher's report
before loading it.
